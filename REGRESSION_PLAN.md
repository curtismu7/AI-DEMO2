# Regression Plan — Super Banking demo

Canonical do-not-break contract for the Super Banking demo. The
`regression-guard` skill (`.claude/skills/regression-guard/`) is the discipline
layer that points here; `CLAUDE.md` also points here. This file is the source of
truth — if the skill and this file disagree, this file wins.

## §0 — UI style rules (hard)

- **Emoji rule (project-wide):** the only emojis allowed in skills, commands,
  code, and UI text are `⚠️` (warning), `✅` (green check), `❌` (red X),
  `🔐` (security/lock — HITL trigger chips), `✕` (close / dismiss), and `✓`
  (check / confirm). Everything else is plain text or CSS icons / semantic HTML.
- **No muted modal text:** modals use solid high-contrast colors, never
  low-contrast gray hint text.
- **Minimal diff:** name the component, name the element, change only that. No
  "while I'm here" cleanup of adjacent code.
- **UI build gate:** after any `demo_api_ui/` change, `cd demo_api_ui && npm run
  build` must exit `0` before the work is complete.

## §1 — Critical do-not-break areas

Before editing any file below, state what you will NOT break, then make a
minimal diff.

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| OAuth admin login | `routes/oauth.js`, `config/oauth.js`, `demo_api_server/.env` |
| OAuth user login | `routes/oauthUser.js`, `config/oauthUser.js` |
| PingOne authorize `resource` + mixed scopes | `utils/oauthAuthorizeResource.js`, `routes/oauthUser.js`, `routes/oauth.js` |
| CRA proxy setup | `demo_api_ui/src/setupProxy.js`, `demo_api_ui/.env` |
| Session persistence | `server.js`, `routes/oauth.js` (`req.session.save()`) |
| Session store callback discipline | `services/lmdb/sessionStore.js` — must call `cb(err)` on every store op |
| Token audience check | `middleware/auth.js` — never hardcode `aud` defaults |
| Status endpoint token expiry | `routes/oauthUser.js`, `routes/oauth.js` — check `expiresAt` |
| REAUTH_KEY re-auth guard | `UserDashboard.js` — clear key only on success |
| Agent form account IDs | `BankingAgent.js` `liveAccounts` state |
| Transfer HITL enforcement | `services/transactionConsentChallenge.js`, `routes/transactions.js` (428 enforcement) |
| Demo accounts on cold-start | `accounts.js`, `demoScenario.js` — save/restore snapshot order |
| Middle layout start state | `UserDashboard.js` `middleAgentOpen` init |
| Bottom dock on dashboard routes | `App.js`, `EmbeddedAgentDock.js` |
| Admin role detection | `routes/oauthUser.js` 4-signal check |
| Customer-only data endpoints | `middleware/auth.js` `requireNotAdmin`, `routes/accounts.js` + `routes/transactions.js` (`/my`) — admin tokens must 403 |
| configStore / Config UI | `services/configStore.js`, `routes/adminConfig.js` |
| Demo Controls diagnose | `ThresholdControls.js` — `data.checks?.userAttribute?.pass` shape |
| BankingAgent FAB | `components/BankingAgent.js`, `App.js` |
| Float panel resize | `BankingAgent.css` (no max-width/height), `BankingAgent.js` (90% caps) |
| OAuth redirect origin | `routes/oauth*.js` — no `localhost` hardcodes |

---

## §3 — Ports (authoritative from `run.sh`)

| Port | Service | Scheme |
|---|---|---|
| `3001` | Banking API Server (BFF) | `https://api.ping.demo:3001` |
| `4000` | Banking UI (React) — public origin, OAuth callbacks land here | `https://api.ping.demo:4000` |
| `3005` | MCP Gateway | `https://api.ping.demo:3005` |
| `3006` | Agent Service | `http://localhost:3006` |
| `3009` | HITL Service | `http://localhost:3009` |
| `8080` | Banking MCP Server | `ws://localhost:8080` |
| `8081` | MCP Invest Server | `ws://localhost:8081` |
| `8082` | Mortgage Service | `http://localhost:8082` |
| `8888` | LangChain Agent (uvicorn main) | `http://localhost:8888` |
| `8889` | LangChain Agent (chat WS) | `ws://localhost:8889` |
| `8890` | LangChain Agent (health) | `http://localhost:8890` |

`api.ping.demo` is the canonical local host (HTTPS via `mkcert`). Code must not
hardcode `localhost:3001` / `localhost:4000` in OAuth callbacks — read the
configured host.

## §4 — Bug Fix Log

Reverse-chronological, newest first.

### 2026-07-04 — BFF crash-loop from stale single-file bind mount of scope-topology.json

**Files changed:**
- `docker-compose.yml` — replaced the fragile single-file mount `./scope-topology.json:/scope-topology.json` with a read-only DIRECTORY mount of the repo root (`./:/repo:ro`) and set `SCOPE_TOPOLOGY_PATH=/repo/scope-topology.json`.
- `demo_api_server/services/scopeTopology.js` — read `process.env.SCOPE_TOPOLOGY_PATH || <repo-root>/scope-topology.json` (default unchanged when unset).
- `demo_api_server/services/configStore.js` — same `SCOPE_TOPOLOGY_PATH` override for its topology read.
- `.husky/post-merge` — when a merge changes `scope-topology.json`, restart `ai-demo-api-server` so it reloads the SSOT (no-op if Docker/BFF is down).

**What was broken:** `scope-topology.json` was bind-mounted into the BFF as a
single file. Single-file bind mounts are pinned to the host file's inode, so when
a `git merge`/`checkout` (or regen) replaced the file with a new inode, the mount
went stale and the file vanished inside the container. `services/mcpWebSocketClient.js`
calls `scopeTopology.allTools()` at require time with no catch, so the next
`node --watch` restart hit `ENOENT: /scope-topology.json` and crash-looped the
whole BFF (all APIs 502).

**What was fixed:** the topology is now read from a directory-mounted path via
`SCOPE_TOPOLOGY_PATH`; directory mounts re-resolve the file on each open, so host
file replacement no longer breaks the container. A post-merge hook restarts the
BFF when the SSOT content changes so the frozen `MCP_TOOL_SCOPES` reload.

**Do not break:** keep `SCOPE_TOPOLOGY_PATH` pointing at a **directory**-mounted
copy (never re-introduce a single-file `:/scope-topology.json` bind mount). The
env override must default to the repo-root path when unset so host/tests/image
builds are unaffected. Do not change tool→scope mapping in `scopeTopology.js`.

**Verify:** `cd demo_api_server && npx jest scopeTopology` → 67 pass. In Docker,
replace the host `scope-topology.json` with a new-inode copy and confirm
`docker exec ai-demo-api-server node -e 'require("/repo/scope-topology.json")'`
still parses and login stays 200 (would ENOENT under the old single-file mount).

### 2026-06-20 — Block admin tokens from the customer dashboard + always-visible Sign Out / Switch

**Files changed:**
- `demo_api_server/middleware/auth.js` — added `requireNotAdmin` (403 `admin_token_forbidden`) and exported it.
- `demo_api_server/routes/accounts.js` — `GET /my` now runs `requireNotAdmin` after `authenticateToken`.
- `demo_api_server/routes/transactions.js` — `GET /my` now runs `requireNotAdmin` after `authenticateToken`.
- `demo_api_ui/src/utils/authUi.js` — added `switchAuthRole(targetRole)` doing a real sign-out + re-login via `POST /api/auth/switch`.
- `demo_api_ui/src/components/TopNav.js` — moved Sign Out out of the scrolling area into an always-visible `.topnav-session-actions` group; added a Switch button; wired the user menu's switch to the real token switch.
- `demo_api_ui/src/components/TopNav.css` — styles for `.topnav-session-actions` / `.topnav-switch-btn`.
- `demo_api_ui/src/components/AdminBlockedDashboard.js` + `.css` — block screen shown on `/dashboard` for admin tokens.
- `demo_api_ui/src/App.js` — `/dashboard` renders `AdminBlockedDashboard` when `user.role === 'admin'`.

**What was broken:** (1) On narrow/zoomed views the only Sign Out lived inside the
horizontally-scrolling toolbar and scrolled off behind the user-menu badge, so
there appeared to be no way to log out. (2) The menu's "Switch view" only changed
the route while keeping the admin token, and `/dashboard` had no role guard — an
admin token could load the customer dashboard and its `/api/*/my` data.

**What was fixed:** Sign Out + a real role/token Switch are now always visible in
the header. `/dashboard` shows a block screen for admin tokens prompting a switch
to a user token, and `/api/accounts/my` + `/api/transactions/my` return 403 for
admin tokens so the enforcement holds at the API too.

**Do not break:** `requireNotAdmin` must stay on the `/my` endpoints, and the
`/dashboard` admin branch must keep rendering `AdminBlockedDashboard` — these are
the enforcement points. The guard intentionally also 403s the `/webmcp` and
`/mcp-traffic` demo panels (which fetch `/api/accounts/my`) for admin tokens.

**Verify:** Sign in as admin → navigate to `/dashboard` → block screen appears
with "Switch to user token". `curl` `GET /api/accounts/my` with an admin session
returns 403 `admin_token_forbidden`. Sign in as a customer → `/dashboard`
hydrates normally. `cd demo_api_ui && npm run build` exits 0.
